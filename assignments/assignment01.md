# Assignment Questions â€“ Artificial Intelligence in Biology

## Genomics & AI:
Explain how Artificial Intelligence methods are used in genomics. Discuss one example where AI improved gene or protein analysis, and evaluate its impact on biomedical research.

## Medical Imaging & Diagnostics:
Compare the role of AI in medical imaging (e.g., radiology, histopathology). How do AI-based systems outperform traditional diagnostic approaches, and what are their limitations?

## Drug Discovery:
Describe how deep learning and generative AI models contribute to drug discovery. Provide a real-world case study (e.g., antibiotic or cancer drug development).

## Ecology & Evolution:
How is AI applied in ecology and evolutionary biology? Discuss one application (such as species recognition, biodiversity monitoring, or evolutionary simulations).

## Ethics & Challenges:
AI in biology brings both opportunities and risks. Discuss two major ethical or practical challenges (e.g., data bias, black-box models, regulatory issues) and propose possible solutions.
